datamations is a framework for automatic generation of explanation of
plots and tables from analysis code. It automatically turns code into
animations, showing the steps that led to a plot or a table.

## Installation

You can install datamations from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("microsoft/datamations")
```

## Usage

To get started, load datamations and dplyr:

``` r
library(datamations)
library(dplyr)
```

### Plot-based datamations

A plot-based datamation shows a plot of what the data looks like at each
step of a pipeline, animated by the transitions that lead to each state.
The following shows an example taking the built-in `small_salary` data
set, grouping by `Degree`, and calculating the mean `Salary`.

First, define the code for the pipeline, then generate the datamation
with `datamation_sanddance()`:

``` r
"small_salary %>% 
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Salary))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-mean_salary_group_by_degree.gif" width="80%" />

You can group by multiple variables, as in this example, grouping by
`Degree` and `Work` before calculating the mean `Salary`:

``` r
"small_salary %>%
  group_by(Degree, Work) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(Salary))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-mean_salary_group_by_degree_work.gif" width="80%" />

datamations has some defaults in terms of how groups are represented. As
seen in the above two examples, when there is one grouping variable,
it’s shown on the x-axis. When there are two grouping variables, the
first (by what comes first in `group_by()`) is shown in column facets,
and the second is shown on the x-axis as well as colored. If there are
three grouping variables, the first is in column facets, the second in
row facets, and the third on the x-axis and colored.

If you would like to change these defaults, or to match an existing plot
style, datamations can take ggplot2 code as input.

For example, to match this plot, which has Work on the x-axis and Degree
in row facets:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

small_salary %>%
  group_by(Work, Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean_salary = mean(Salary)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Work, y = mean_salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Degree))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-ggplot2-existing-plot-1.png" width="80%" />

Simply define the code and pass to `datamation_sanddance()`, which will
produce an animation with desired plot layout.

``` r
"small_salary %>%
  group_by(Work, Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean_salary = mean(Salary)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Work, y = mean_salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Degree))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-mean_salary_group_by_degree_work_ggplot.gif" width="80%" />

When ggplot2 code is provided, the order of animation is not determined
by the order in `group_by()`, but by the plot layout. Variables are
first animated by what’s in the column facets, then the row facets, by
the x-axis, and finally by color.

Some limitations:

-   `facet_wrap()` is not supported - please use `facet_grid()`
-   datamations expects different variables in the column and row facets
    than in the x-axis. datamations generated that do not match this
    layout may look different than the final plot!
-   Only `geom_point()` is supported, e.g. specifying `geom_bar()` will
    not produce a bar in the datamation.

### Table-based datamations

A table-based datamation shows a mock table of what the data looks like
at each step of pipeline, again animated by the transitions that lead to
each state. The following shows our same first example: taking the
built-in `small_salary` data set, grouping by `Degree`, and calculating
the mean `Salary`, using the same pipeline.

You can generate a table-based datamation with `datamation_tibble()`:

``` r
datamation_tibble(
  pipeline = "small_salary %>% group_by(Degree) %>% summarize(mean = mean(Salary))",
  output = "mean_salary_group_by_degree.gif"
)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-mean_salary_group_by_degree-table.gif" width="80%" />

Datamations work on any dataset provided, as in this example taking
`mtcars` and grouping by `cyl`:

``` r
mtcars_group_cyl <- "mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)"
datamation_tibble(mtcars_group_cyl, output = "mtcars_group_cyl.gif")
```
